## Gene Expression Dynamics Simulation

### Description

This code simulates the dynamics of gene expression using ordinary differential equations (ODEs). It models the changes in mRNA and protein concentrations over time, illustrating the transcription and translation processes.

### Usage

1. Open the `central_dogma_ode.py, gene_model_activation.py, gene_model_repression.py` file in a Python environment or an integrated development environment (IDE).
2. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy).
3. Run the script to execute the simulation and visualize the gene expression dynamics.

## Molecular Concentration Simulation

### Description

This code simulates molecular concentration dynamics in a biological system using ODEs. It focuses on the behavior of two(three) molecular species, G1 and G2(or G3), over a defined time span.

### Usage

1. Open the `oscillating_gene_network.py, stochastic_oscillator.py` file in a Python environment or an integrated development environment (IDE).
2. Make sure you have the required libraries installed (Matplotlib, SciPy, NumPy).
3. Run the script to execute the simulation and visualize the molecular concentration dynamics.

## Requirements

To run the provided code samples, you need the following Python libraries:

- NumPy
- Matplotlib
